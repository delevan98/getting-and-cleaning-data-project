# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains all of the necessary files for the **Getting and Cleaning Data** course project. Included in this repository is the required **run_analysis.R** which when executed, will:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This means that the script will do exactly what is asked in the instructions for the project. This readme will be updated if any important ionformation changes:
